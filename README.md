# Passage3D

## Getting Started
Passage is the first **metaverse** experience on the Cosmos ecosystem!
Passage brings tools to make accessible, tailored virtual worlds which can
be streamed through a browser without hardware requirements. Our Mission is to Empower World
Builders to Drive Interactions, Content and AudienceS to Cosmos. Artists, projects, influencers,
and on-chain games will bring ordinary and 3D-asset NFTs that can be used, bought, and sold on
the Passage Marketplace

## Core Features
- **The first “metaverse” experience on the Cosmos Ecosystem.**
    - Passage provides an accessible and easy to use way for individuals,
      projects, and organisations to create immersive 3D-worlds and connect
      them with other worlds in the ecosystem.
    - These worlds are accessible through a browser on almost any device. A
      local client will also be offered so that people are able to use their own 		
      hardware to enter the world without the streaming service.
    - Passage utilizes the unstoppable cloud computing network, Akash.
    - The Ecosystem where the Multiplayer RPG game The Strange Clan is
      being built!
- **The first NFT marketplace on the Cosmos ecosystem that uses the Cosmos
  native ATOM as one of the main mediums of exchange.**
    - Marketplace launch on Juno early Q1-2022.
    - Launches with the 5000 minted Strange Clan NFTs, followed by
      another 5000 NFT-characters in Q1-2022 as well as game related NFTs.
    - Several partners are lined up to bolster available NFT content.
    - The Marketplace will host both game content and NFTs with viewable 		
      3D-assets that can also be used in worldbuilding.
    - The Marketplace will enable open NFT-creation similarly to Ethereum’s
      OpenSea during 2022.
